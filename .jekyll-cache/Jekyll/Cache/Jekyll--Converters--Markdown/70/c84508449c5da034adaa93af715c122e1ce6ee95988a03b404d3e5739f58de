<p>In finance, Value at Risk (VaR) is a crucial metric for asessing the risk of an investment portfolio. VaR provides an estimate of rare but potential loss an investment may face over a specific time horizon and confidence level. To calculate VaR, it’s necessary to have an understanding of the underlying distribution of investment returns.</p>

<p>To accurately determine this distribution, various models from time series analysis can be used. The GARCH model, in particular, is known for its effectiveness in analyzing financial data. One of the main reasons to choose GARCH over other models, such as empirical distribution (actually it is even model-free), random walk, or ARIMA, is that it can capture the volatility dynamics of the stock return, which is essential for accurate VaR calculation of financial asset return.</p>

<p>Whose distribution exactly do we want to figure out for VaR calculation?  Long story short, we indentify the distribution of log returns of McDonald’s stock due to the desirable characteristics of log returns for statistical or practical analysis purpose.</p>

<p>The terms “prices”, “simple returns” and “log returns” refer to different ways of measuring the performance of an investment over time. Price is the most common form of financial asset data we can encounter and the other two are transformed version of this. Let $P_{t}$, $R_{t}$ and $r_{t}$ respectively denote the price, simple return and log return of McDonald’s stock at time $t$. Then $R_{t}$ and $r_{t}$ are defined as</p>

<p>$R_{t}=\dfrac{P_{t}-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}\tag{1}$</p>

<p>$r_{t}=log \left(\dfrac{P_{t}}{P_{t-1}}\right)=log(1+R_{t})\tag{2}$</p>

<p>Both  $R_{t}$ and $r_t$ are measure of the relative movements of price, which is a useful property for comparison of performance between assets, but the latter one is often prefered over the other.</p>

<p>Cool!</p>

<p>add equations and Let’s say the company is mcdonald and  change the title more attractive to general public (for example how much can we expect to lose from investment in mcdonald stock)</p>
