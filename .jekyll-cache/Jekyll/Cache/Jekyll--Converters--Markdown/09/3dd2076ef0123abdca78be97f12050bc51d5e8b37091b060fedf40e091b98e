<p>Taylorâ€™s Series is a useful mathematical tool to approximate an unknown function with polynomial terms around a specific point.</p>

<p>Let $f(x)$ be an unknown infinitely-differentiable function of a variable $x$ and $x_{0}$ be a specific point around which we want to approximate the function.</p>

<p>$f(x) = c_0+c_{1}(x-x_{0})+c_{2}(x-x_{0})^{2}+c_{3}(x-x_{0})^{3}+â€¦\tag{1}$</p>

<p>The constant $a$ is subtracted from all the polynomial terms for notational convenience. It is not difficult to show the coefficients for the polynomials, $c_{0}, c_{1}, c_{2}, â€¦$ are found by taking the value of the derivatives of the both sides at the point $x=a$ as below.</p>

\[\begin{align}
f(x_{0}) &amp;= c_{0}\\
f^{'}(x_{0}) &amp;= 1! \cdot c_{1}\\
f^{''}(x_{0}) &amp;= 2! \cdot c_{2}\\
f^{'''}(x_{0}) &amp;= 3! \cdot c_{3}\\
&amp; \vdots
\end{align} \tag{2}\]

<p>Then we can rewrite the Equation $1$ as follows.</p>

\[\begin{align}
f(x) &amp;= f(x_{0}) + \dfrac{f^{'}(x_{0})}{1!}(x-x_{0}) + \dfrac{f^{''}(x_{0})}{2!}(x-x_{0})^{2} + \dfrac{f^{'''}(x_{0})}{3!}(x-x_{0})^{3} + ...\\
&amp;= \sum^{\infty}_{i=0}\frac{f^i(x_{0})}{i!}(x-x_{0})^i
\end{align} \tag{3}\]

<p>Here $f^{i}$ is the $i$-th order derivative of $f$ and $f^{0}=f$.</p>

<p>The approximation is well behaved when the constant a
We can generalize the equation $3$ by replacing the variable $x$ with some spe</p>
