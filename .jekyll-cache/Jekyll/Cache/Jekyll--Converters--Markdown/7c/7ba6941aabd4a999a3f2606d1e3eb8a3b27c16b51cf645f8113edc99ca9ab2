I"´<p>At the first class of an advanced Econometrics at my graduate school, I volunteered for exercise problems to prove some estimators are unbiased and consistent mathematically. Proving whether estimators are unbiased is rather easy but the case of consistency was quite tricky. I did remember from my self-study in Econometrics that when the variance of the estimator probabilitically converges to zero, we can say the estimator is consistent. This proof is closely related to Chebyshevâ€™s Inequality but I could not fomulate the proof. After the class, I went back to [the old positing] I wrote about Chebyshevâ€™s Inequality in Korean one year ago and decided to write this positing.</p>
