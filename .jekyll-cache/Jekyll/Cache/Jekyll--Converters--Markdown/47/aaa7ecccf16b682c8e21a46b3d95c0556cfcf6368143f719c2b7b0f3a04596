I"«<p>During the first class of my advanced Econometrics course at graduate school, I volunteered to solve some exercise problems that involved proving certain estimators were unbiased and consistent mathematically. While proving whether estimators were unbiased was trivial, demonstrating consistency was more challenging. However, I remembered from my self-study in Econometrics that if the variance of the estimator converges to zero probabilistically, we can conclude that the estimator is consistent. The proof is closely related to Markovâ€™s Inequality, but I had difficulty formulating it during the class. After the class, I revisited <a href="(https://blog.naver.com/boadoboado11/222684138583)">an old post</a> I had written about Markovâ€™s Inequality in Korean from a year ago and decided to write this post.</p>

<h2 id="markovs-inequality">Markovâ€™s Inequality</h2>
<p>Markovâ€™s Inequailty is fomulated as follows.</p>

<p>$P(X \geq a) \leq \dfrac{E(X)}{a} \quad \forall_X \geq 0, \forall_a \geq 0 \tag{1}$</p>

<p>Here $X$ is a positive random variable with a finite mean and variance, and $a$ is a positive constant. The inequality always holds regardless of the distribution of $X$.</p>

<p>The proof is quite straightforward.</p>

<p>When there is a continuous random variable $X$ and $f(X)$ is a probability density function of $X$,</p>

\[\begin{align}
E(X) 
&amp;= \displaystyle{\int_{0}^{\infty}} xf(x)dx\\
&amp;= \displaystyle{\int_{0}^{a}} xf(x)dx + \displaystyle{\int_{a}^{\infty}} xf(x)dx\\
&amp;\geq \displaystyle{\int_{a}^{\infty}} xf(x)dx\\
&amp;\geq \displaystyle{\int_{a}^{\infty}} af(x)dx = aP(X \geq a) \quad \because x \geq a
\end{align} \tag{2}\]
