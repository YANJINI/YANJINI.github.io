I"š<p>During the first class of my advanced Econometrics course at graduate school, I volunteered to solve some exercise problems that involved proving certain estimators were unbiased and consistent mathematically. While proving whether estimators were unbiased was trivial, demonstrating consistency was more challenging. However, I remembered from my self-study in Econometrics that if the variance of the estimator converges to zero probabilistically, we can conclude that the estimator is consistent. The proof is closely related to Markovâ€™s Inequality, but I had difficulty formulating it during the class. After the class, I revisited <a href="(https://blog.naver.com/boadoboado11/222684138583)">an old post</a> I had written about Markovâ€™s Inequality in Korean from a year ago and decided to write this post.</p>

<h2 id="markovs-inequality">Markovâ€™s Inequality</h2>
<p>Markovâ€™s Inequailty is fomulated as follows.</p>

<p>$P(X \geq a) \leq \dfrac{E(X)}{a} \quad \forall_X \geq 0, \forall_a \geq 0 \tag{1}$</p>

<p>Here $X$ is a positive random variable with a finite mean and variance, and $a$ is a positive constant. The inequality always holds regardless of the distribution of $X$.</p>

<p>The proof is quite straightforward.</p>

<p>When there is a continuous random variable $X$ and $f(X)$ is a probability density function of $X$,</p>

<p>$\begin{align}
E(X) 
&amp;= \displaystyle{\int_{0}^{\infty}} xf(x)dx<br />
&amp;= \displaystyle{\int_{0}^{a}} xf(x)dx + \displaystyle{\int_{a}^{\infty}} xf(x)dx<br />
&amp;\geq \displaystyle{\int_{a}^{\infty}} xf(x)dx<br />
&amp;\geq \displaystyle{\int_{a}^{\infty}} af(x)dx \quad \because x 
\end{align} \tag{2}$</p>

<p>This inequality is true because $X$ is a non-negative random variable. When we integrate $xf(x)$ over the interval $[a, \infty)$, we are essentially calculating the weighted average of the values of $X$ that are greater than or equal to $a$. The weight given to each value $x$ is $f(x)$, the probability density function of $X$ evaluated at $x$.</p>

<p>Since $X$ is non-negative, the value of $xf(x)$ is always greater than or equal to $af(x)$ when $x$ is greater than or equal to $a$. This is because $a$ is non-negative, and multiplying a non-negative number by a non-negative number gives a non-negative result. Therefore, the weighted average of the values of $X$ that are greater than or equal to $a$ is always greater than or equal to the weighted average of $a$ over the same interval, which is simply $a$ times the integral of $f(x)$ over the interval $[a, \infty)$.</p>

<p>Mathematically, we can write this as:</p>

\[\begin{align*} \int_{a}^{\infty} xf(x)dx &amp;\geq \int_{a}^{\infty} af(x)dx \\ \int_{a}^{\infty} xf(x)dx &amp;\geq a \int_{a}^{\infty} f(x)dx \\ \frac{1}{a} \int_{a}^{\infty} xf(x)dx &amp;\geq \int_{a}^{\infty} f(x)dx \\ E(X) &amp;\geq a \int_{a}^{\infty} f(x)dx \\ \end{align*}\]

<p>where $E(X)$ is the expected value of $X$. Therefore, the inequality holds because of the non-negativity of $X$ and $a$.</p>

<p>In the integral $\displaystyle{\int_{a}^{\infty}} xf(x)dx$, we are integrating over the interval $[a, \infty)$. This means that the variable $x$ takes on values greater than or equal to $a$ over the interval of integration. Therefore, $x$ is greater than or equal to $a$ for all values of $x$ in the interval of integration. In other words, we can say that $x$ is greater than or equal to $a$ because we are integrating over the interval $[a, \infty)$.</p>
