        <span class="caption-label">Figure 1.</span> Diagram of rejection sampling. The 
        density $q(\mathbf{z})$ must be always greater than $p(\mathbf{x})$. A new sample 
        is rejected if it falls in the gray region and accepted otherwise. These accepted 
        samples are distributed according to $p(\mathbf{x})$. This is achieved by sampling 
        $z_i$ from $q(\mathbf{z})$, and then sampling uniformly from $[0, k q(z_i)]$. 
        Samples under the curve $p(z_i)$ are accepted.
