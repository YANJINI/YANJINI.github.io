I"<p>During the first class of my advanced Econometrics course at graduate school, I volunteered to solve some exercise problems that involved proving certain estimators were unbiased and consistent mathematically. While proving whether estimators were unbiased was trivial, demonstrating consistency was more challenging. However, I remembered from my self-study in Econometrics that if the variance of the estimator converges to zero probabilistically, we can conclude that the estimator is consistent. The proof is closely related to Chebyshev’s Inequality, but I had difficulty formulating it during the class. After the class, I revisited <a href="(https://blog.naver.com/boadoboado11/222684138583)">an old post</a> I had written about Chebyshev’s Inequality in Korean from a year ago and decided to write this post.</p>

<h2 id="chebyshevs-inequality">Chebyshev’s Inequality</h2>
<p>Chebyshev’s Inequailty is fomulated as follows.</p>

<p>$P(X \geq a) \leq \dfra\forall_{X} \geq 0, \forall_a \geq 0 \tag{1}$</p>
