<p>Taylorâ€™s Series is a useful mathematical tool to approximate an unknown function with polynomial terms around a specific point.</p>

<p>Let $f(x)$ be an unknown infinitely-differentiable function of a variable $x$ and $a$ be a specific point around which we want to approximate the function.</p>

<p>$f(x) = c_0+c_{1}(x-a)+c_{2}(x-a)^{2}+c_{3}(x-a)^{3}+â€¦\tag{1}$</p>

<p>The constant $a$ is subtracted from all the polynomial terms for notational convenience. The coefficients for the polynomials, $c_{0}, c_{1}, c_{2}, â€¦$ are found by taking the value of the derivatives of the both sides at the point $x=a$. It i</p>

\[\begin{align}
f(a) = c_{0}\\
f^{'}(a) = c_{1}
\end{align} \tag{2}\]
