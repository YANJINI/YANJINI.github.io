<p>Taylorâ€™s Series is a useful mathematical tool to approximate an unknown function with polynomial terms around a specific point.</p>

<p>Let $f(x)$ be an unknown infinitely-differentiable function of a variable $x$ and $x_{0}$ be a specific poin, and we would like to approximate this function with polynomials as follows.</p>

<p>$f(x) = c_0+c_{1}x+c_{2}x^{2}+c_{3}x^{3}+â€¦\tag{1}$</p>
