<p>Taylor’s Series is a useful mathematical tool to approximate an unknown function with polynomial terms.</p>

<p>Let $f(x)$ be an unknown infinitely-differentiable function of a variable $x$ and we would like to approximate this function with polynomials as follows.</p>

<p>$c_0+c_{1}x+c_{2}x^{2}+c_{3}x^{3}+…\tag{1}$</p>
