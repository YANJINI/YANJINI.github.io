<p>Taylor’s Series is a useful mathematical tool for approximating an unknown function with polynomial terms around a specific point. Let $f(x)$ be an infinitely-differentiable function of a variable $x$ and $a$ be the point around which we want to approximate the function. The function can be represented as</p>

<p>$f(x) = c_0+c_{1}(x-a)+c_{2}(x-a)^{2}+c_{3}(x-a)^{3}+…\tag{1}$</p>

<p>Here, we subtract the constant $a$ from all polynomial terms for notational convenience. We can find the coefficients for the polynomials $c_0, c_1, c_2,$ and so on, by taking the value of the derivatives of both sides at the point $x=a$ as follows.</p>

\[\begin{align}
f(a) &amp;= c_{0}\\
f^{'}(a) &amp;= 1! \cdot c_{1}\\
f^{''}(a) &amp;= 2! \cdot c_{2}\\
f^{'''}(a) &amp;= 3! \cdot c_{3}\\
&amp; \vdots
\end{align} \tag{2}\]

<p>Then we can rewrite Equation $1$ as follows.</p>

\[\begin{align}
f(x) &amp;= f(a) + \dfrac{f^{'}(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \dfrac{f^{''}(a)}{2!}(x-a)^{2} + \dfrac{f^{'''}(a)}{3!}(x-a)^{3} + ...\\
&amp;= \sum^{\infty}_{i=0}\frac{f^i(a)}{i!}(x-a)^i
\end{align} \tag{3}\]

<p>Here, $f^{(i)}$ denotes the $i$-th order derivative of $f$, and $f^{(0)} = f$. The approximation is well-behaved when $x$ is close enough to $a$.</p>

<p>We can generalize Equation $3$ by setting $x = a+h$, where $h$ is a small enough constant.</p>

\[\begin{align}
f(a+h) &amp;= f(a) + \dfrac{f^{'}(a)}{1!}h + \dfrac{f^{''}(a)}{2!}h^{2} + \dfrac{f^{'''}(a)}{3!}h^{3} + ...\\
&amp;= \sum^{\infty}_{i=0}\frac{f^i(a)}{i!}h^i
\end{align} \tag{4}\]

<p>The form in Equation $4$ is useful because it explicitly shows the change in output given different inputs $a+h$ and $h$, which is $f(a+h) - f(a)$. This is fundamental for numerical optimization, where we try to find the optimal point of an unknown function given only input and output.</p>
