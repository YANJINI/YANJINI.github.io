I"×<p>In finance, Value at Risk (VaR) is a crucial metric for asessing the risk of an investment portfolio. VaR provides an estimate of the rare but potential loss an investment may face over a specific time horizon and confidence level. Since VaR is basically to say how much we can expect to lose in the event of a rare event with a 5% or 1% probability of occurrence for a particular period of time, it requires the underlying distribution of the investment returns.</p>
