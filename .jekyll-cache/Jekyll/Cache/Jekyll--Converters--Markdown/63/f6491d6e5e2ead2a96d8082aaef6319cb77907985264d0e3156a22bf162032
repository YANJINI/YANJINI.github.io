<p>Taylorâ€™s Series is a useful mathematical tool to approximate an unknown function with polynomial terms around a specific point.</p>

<p>Let $f(x)$ be an unknown infinitely-differentiable function of a variable $x$ and $a$ be a specific point around which we want to approximate the function.</p>

<p>$f(x) = c_0+c_{1}(x-a)+c_{2}(x-a)^{2}+c_{3}(x-a)^{3}+â€¦\tag{1}$</p>

<p>The constant $a$ is subtracted from all the polynomial terms for notational convenience. It is not difficult to show the coefficients for the polynomials, $c_{0}, c_{1}, c_{2}, â€¦$ are found by taking the value of the derivatives of the both sides at the point $x=a$ as below.</p>

\[\begin{align}
f(a) &amp;= c_{0}\\
f^{'}(a) &amp;= 1! \cdot c_{1}\\
f^{''}(a) &amp;= 2! \cdot c_{2}\\
f^{'''}(a) &amp;= 3! \cdot c_{3}\\
&amp; \vdots
\end{align} \tag{2}\]

<p>Then we can rewrite the Equation $1$ as follows.</p>

\[\begin{align}
f(x) &amp;= f(a) + \dfrac{f^{'}(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \dfrac{f^{''}(a)}{2!}(x-a)^{2} + \dfrac{f^{'''}(a)}{3!}(x-a)^{3} + ...\\
&amp;= \sum^{\infty}_{i=0}\frac{f^i(a)}{i!}(x-a)^i
\end{align} \tag{3}\]

<p>Here $f^{i}$ is the $i$-th order derivative of $f$ and $f^{0}=f$. The approximation is well behaved when the variable $x$ is close enough to the point $a$.</p>

<p>We can generalize the Equation $3$ by setting $x = a+h$. Here $h$ is some small enough constant and $a$ is the point around which we want to approximate the function just as defined above.</p>

\[\begin{align}
f(a+h) &amp;= f(a) + \dfrac{f^{'}(a)}{1!}h + \dfrac{f^{''}(a)}{2!}h^{2} + \dfrac{f^{'''}(a)}{3!}h^{3} + ...\\
&amp;= \sum^{\infty}_{i=0}\frac{f^i(a)}{i!}h^i
\end{align} \tag{4}\]

<p>The form in Equation $4$ is useful, since it holds</p>
