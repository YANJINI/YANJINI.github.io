<p>Taylor’s Series is a useful mathematical tool for approximating an unknown function with polynomial terms around a specific point. Let $f(x)$ be an infinitely-differentiable function of a variable $x$ and $a$ be the point around which we want to approximate the function. The function can be represented as the follow</p>
