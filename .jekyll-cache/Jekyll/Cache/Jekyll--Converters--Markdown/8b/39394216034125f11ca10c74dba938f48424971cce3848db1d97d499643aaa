<p>Taylor’s Series is a useful mathematical tool to approximate an unknown function with polynomial terms around a specific point.</p>

<p>Let $f(x)$ be an unknown infinitely-differentiable function of a variable $x$ and $a$ be a specific point around which we want to approximate the function.</p>

<p>$f(x) = c_0+c_{1}(x-a)+c_{2}(x-a)^{2}+c_{3}(x-a)^{3}+…\tag{1}$</p>

<p>The constant $a$ is subtracted from all the polynomial terms for notational convenience. It is not difficult to show the coefficients for the polynomials, $c_{0}, c_{1}, c_{2}, …$ are found by taking the value of the derivatives of the both sides at the point $x=a$ as below.</p>

\[\begin{align}
f(a) &amp;= c_{0}\\
f^{'}(a) &amp;= 1! \cdot c_{1}\\
f^{''}(a) &amp;= 2! \cdot c_{2}\\
f^{'''}(a) &amp;= 3! \cdot c_{3}\\
f^{''''}(a) &amp;= 4! \cdot c_{4}\\
&amp; \vdots
\end{align} \tag{2}\]

<p>Then we can rewrite the Equation $1$ as follows.</p>

\[\begin{algin}
f(x) &amp;= f(a) + \dfrac{f^{'}(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \dfrac{f^{''}(a)}{2!}(x-a)^{2} + \\

\end{algin} \tag{3}\]
