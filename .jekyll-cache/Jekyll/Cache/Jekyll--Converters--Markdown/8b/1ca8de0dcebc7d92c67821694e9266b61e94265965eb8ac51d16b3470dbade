I"±<p>During the last semester of 2022-2 in my graduate program, I completed a course entitled ‚ÄúCredit Scoring‚Äù. The course focused on developing a strategy for deciding which customers to grant loans to, based on the probability of default metric built using statistical modeling techniques. While I appreciated the professor‚Äôs passion and found the course interesting, I didn‚Äôt learn as much as I hoped. The explanations were too vague, and the final project only involved changing some parameters in his SAS code. To better understand credit scoring and the theoretical background behind it, I took <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/credit-risk-modeling-in-python/">Credit Risk Modeling in Python</a> course from Udemy and decided to build my own model using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data">Home Credit Risk</a> data from Kaggle and supplement it with additional theoretical material.</p>
