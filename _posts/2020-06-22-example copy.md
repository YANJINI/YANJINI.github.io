title: Scaling Factors for Hidden Markov Models
subtitle: Inference for hidden Markov models (HMMs) is numerically unstable. A standard approach to resolving this instability is to use scaling factors. I discuss this idea in detail.

## Heading
Here are some words. And this is some math:

{% katexmm %}
This works exactly the same as obsidian $x$ and $y$
$$
e = mc^2. djfndj\tag{1}
$$
{% endkatexmm %}

{% katex %}
c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
{% endkatex %}

{% katex display %}
c = \pm\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
{% endkatex %}


## df

Cool!
